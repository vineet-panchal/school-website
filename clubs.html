            <p id="clubs-writeup">The importance of clubs & councils is that it gives you something fun to do aside from school. It allows you to explore what you may be interested in beyond academics. Being part of a club/council will enable you to make new friends and meet new people and provides you with a support network. Here at SJPII, there are a variety of clubs and councils that you can join. From the Coding Club to the Executive Student Council, there are many things you can do aside from academics at SJPII.</p>

            <p id="esc-writeup">The Executive Student Council (ESC) works to do primarily two things simultaneously; foster school spirit and amplify the student voice. We come together as leaders to plan and implement initiatives, events, and activities that help students have the best time possible here at SJPII and feel that they are a valued member of the Panther community. From events like spirit week and winterlicious, to holding trivia and town halls, we want all students to get involved, and hope that we can have a lasting impact on our school community. Our members are always willing to help and our dms are always open @escsjpii on instagram or by emailing escsjpii@gmail.com. If you ever need anything at all, or have questions, suggestions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out! </p>

We focus on all strands of art such as Visual, Musical, Cinematic, Literature, etc. Every Wednesday in room 258, we discuss initiatives that can be done around the school in order to show off all our panther's artistic talents. Coming to a meeting is a great way to chill with fellow panthers as well as get hours! For every meeting attended that is one hour gained for you. Also if you participate in an initiative (make an announcement, post, or even cut up a picture) you also get hours! Our committee is dedicated to bringing out the creative sides of those who are afraid to show off their skills. For more information dm @sjp.arts or email us at sjpiiartcommittee@gmail.com</p>

            <p id="spirit-writeup">Spirit Squad is finally making a comeback at SJPII with our first performance being in May of 2022! Spirit Squad composed of students who are passionate about utilizing dance as a way to increase and heighten spirit at SJPII.From cultural dances to varying songs, we give the student body an opportunity to bond as a community and encourage all to participate in school-wide events as our dancers showcase their talent. Our features within the school year are often during pep rallies, however, it is to be extended to various SJPII events, such as International Night, Talent Night, and more! We believe dance is a form of expression that words can’t put out and we can’t wait to showcase all we got this year and the years to come!</p>

            <p id="fsa-writeup">The FSA at SJPII is a place where students come together to learn about and celebrate Philippine culture, language and history as well as get to know and support each other. Our goal is to be a safe place for Filipinx students to share their unique perspectives, create resources as well as spread awareness, deepen understanding and celebrate Philippine excellence in the SJPII community. We also hope to establish relationships with community members to further support the needs of Filipinx students, parents, educators and the larger Filipinx-Canadian community.</p>
            <p id="fsa-writeup">We have no official executive team at this time. Questions can be directed to Ms. David (marylou.david@tcdsb.org or davidm02@tcdsb.ca). We are hoping to give increased leadership roles to our senior students.</p>

For those who have families and friends far away, it can often be daunting to come and study at Cardiff. However, this society provides a platform for many lifelong friendships. This society is not only aimed at those who speak the language (Tamil - which is spoken in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore and many more) - it is a very diverse and multicultural society and suits people who want to learn more about the culture or just want to enjoy the variety of events with us!</p>

            <p id="env-writeup">The Environmental Council is SJPII’s home for those who want to have a positive influence on the world by pursuing eco-friendly initiatives of local and global engagement. Whether it be fundraising to clean the oceans, working on the Panther Patch (the school’s garden), or working towards reducing the school’s ecological footprint, the Environmental Council is involved. We look forward to pursuing many more opportunities during this 2022-2023 school year with events like Swaparama and revamping the school’s waste management. Meeting every Wednesday after school, the Environmental Council puts in a great effort to ensure the events that students can engage with the environment are both enjoyable and make a positive difference in the world. The council is quite big but we encourage all the more individuals to participate since what better way to get involved with the global community than with the outstanding community at SJPII’s Environmental Council?</p>
